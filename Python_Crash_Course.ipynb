    "This is a quick introduction to Python. There are lots of other places to learn the language more thoroughly. There are many online resources for Python including ones to other learning resources, at the end of this notebook. If you want a little more depth, [Python Tutorial](http://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/) is a great place to start, as is Zed Shaw's [Learn Python the Hard Way](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/). Besides that, there are many **Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs)** such as [Introduction to Data Science in Python](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-data-analysis), [Introduction to Python for Data Science](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-python-for-data-science), [Applied Data Science with Python Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-science-python) and many more.\n",

There's a good introduction to notebooks [in the IPython notebook documentation](http://ipython.org/notebook.html) that even has a [nice video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6dLGQw9yFQ#!) on how to use the notebooks. You should probably also flip through the [IPython tutorial](http://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) in your copious free time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Briefly, notebooks have code cells (that are generally followed by result cells) and text cells. The text cells are the stuff that you're reading now. The code cells start with \"In []:\" with some number generally in the brackets. If you put your cursor in the code cell and hit Shift-Enter, the code will run in the Python interpreter and the result will print out in the output cell. You can then change things around and see whether you understand what's going on. If you need to know more, see the [Jupyter notebook documentation](http://ipython.org/notebook.html) or the [IPython tutorial](http://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)."
